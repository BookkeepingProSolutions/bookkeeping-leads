## 🚀 START MARKETING TODAY (No Setup Required)

### Option 1: Post on LinkedIn (5 minutes)

**Copy/paste this post RIGHT NOW:**

```
I've helped 100+ construction businesses save $2.3M in taxes.

Here are the 5 most expensive mistakes I see:

1. Not separating business & personal finances
2. Waiting until tax season to plan  
3. Missing vehicle/equipment deductions
4. Poor job costing (no profit visibility)
5. DIY bookkeeping instead of running the business

Which one hits home for you? 

P.S. I created a FREE guide with solutions to all 5:

Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s bookkeeping

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Company Name] and was impressed by [mention a project].

Quick question: Are you tracking job profitability in real-time?

I ask because I specialize in bookkeeping for construction companies, and I see this constantly - businesses don't know which jobs are profitable until it's too late.

I recently helped a contractor discover they were losing $3,200/month on a project they thought was profitable. One small change saved them $38K/year.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call?

I'll share:
- The #1 bookkeeping mistake construction companies make
- A simple framework to track job profitability  
- How to pay yourself more while paying less in taxes

No pitch, just value. Reply "YES" and I'll send some times.

Best,
