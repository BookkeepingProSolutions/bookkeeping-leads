### Cold Outreach Emails (Use templates from marketing/outreach-templates.md)

**Send to 25 construction companies this week.**

**Template (copy/paste and personalize):**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s bookkeeping

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Company Name] and was impressed by [specific project].

Quick question: Are you currently tracking job profitability in real-time?

I specialize in bookkeeping for construction companies and see this issue constantly - businesses don't know which jobs are profitable until it's too late.

I recently helped a contractor discover they were losing $3,200/month on a project they thought was profitable. One adjustment saved them $38K/year.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call where I can share:
- The #1 bookkeeping mistake construction companies make
- A simple framework to track job profitability
- How to pay yourself more while paying less in taxes

No pitch, just value. Reply "YES" and I'll send times.

Best,
[Your Name]
